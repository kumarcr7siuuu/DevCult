# Instagram Content Templates for Silver Cosmic

Since you're building a high-tech/design brand, your "templates" should be consistent layouts that you repeat. This builds brand recognition.

## 1. The "Work Showcase" (For sharing your projects)
**Goal:** Show off your design/coding skills.
**Visual Style:** Clean device frame (laptop or phone) on a blurred, abstract background.

*   **Slide 1 (Hook):** High-res screenshot of the project with a bold title overlay.
    *   *Caption:* "Project Reveal: [Project Name] 🚀"
*   **Slide 2 (The Problem):** Text or simple graphic explaining what you solved.
    *   *Text:* "Challenge: Creating a 3D experience that loads instantly."
*   **Slide 3 (The Solution):** Video/GIF of the interaction or code snippet.
    *   *Text:* "Solution: Used React Three Fiber for optimized rendering."
*   **Slide 4 (CTA):** "Need a site like this? DM 'BUILD' to start."

## 2. The "Code vs. Output" (For Devs)
**Goal:** Show your technical expertise.
**Visual Style:** Split screen. Left side = VS Code theme. Right side = Live website.

*   **Caption Structure:**
    *   "How it started 💻 vs How it's going ✨"
    *   Brief explanation of the function/hook used.
    *   **Tags:** #coding #webdev #nextjs #react

## 3. The "Educational Carousel" (Value)
**Goal:** Teach your audience something (saves/shares).
**Visual Style:** Dark mode card with glowing borders.

*   **Card 1:** Title: "3 Tools I use for [Task]"
*   **Card 2:** Tool 1 + Screenshot + Why you love it.
*   **Card 3:** Tool 2 + Screenshot + Why you love it.
*   **Card 4:** Tool 3 + Screenshot + Why you love it.
*   **Card 5:** Summary list + "Save this for later 📌"

## 4. The "Thought Leader" (Minimalist)
**Goal:** Share an opinion or update.
**Visual Style:** Solid dark background (Hex: #0a0a0a), large Serif font (white), small logo at bottom.

*   **Content:**
    *   "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works."
    *   "Just shipped the MVP for Silver Cosmic. Here's what I learned..."
